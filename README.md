# Restaurant Project

## Aim of the project

We were in charge of creating the site of a restaurant and being able to take orders directly from the site.  
By following [these](https://github.com/becodeorg/bxl-hopper-1-25/blob/master/The%20Hill/projects/3.restaurant/readme.md) instructions, we were able to create it.

## Result
You can [here](https://cemil1000.github.io/Restaurant/) find our website heberged on github pages.

We decided to take a restaurant serving vietnamese/fusion cuisine, and called Nenu.  

We built the site with **Bulma** as **CSS** framework.  

We decided to work with multiple **HTML** pages and you can navigate between each page by clicking on the different buttons of the navbar.   

* On the *Home* page of the site you can find pics, a description of the restaurant and the opening hours (coded with **JS**). When the hour is red it means that the restaurant is closed for the moment, when it's green it's open.

* On the *Menu* page we've worked with the Bulma cards to create all of our Menu, on each card you have a button to add a meal to your basket, after having all your articles you can finally order everything you want.

* And finally on the *Find Us* page you can find all the informations to contact the restaurant, because everything was done during our training bootcamp at BeCode we put the address of BeCode as address for the restaurant, the two e-mails are not real e-mails address.
